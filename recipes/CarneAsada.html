	<h2> Steps </h2>
	
	<h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large <br>
			glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, <br>
			paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade <br>
			and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the <br>
			steak is cooked. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) <br>
			on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a <br>
			thickness of 1/4 inch.  </li>
			<br>
			<li> After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large <br>
			bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours. </li>
			<br>
			<li> When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Cook steak on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Remove steak from grill and slice across the grain. </li>
			<br>
			<li> Place on a serving platter and pour the reserved, unused marinade over top. Serve immediately. </li>
