	<h1> Baked Asian-Style Honey Chicken Ready For Family Night </h2>
	
	<h3>
		<p> This Asian-style honey chicken uses a marinade of ginger, <br>
		soy sauce, onion, and garlic to give this dish delicious flavor <br>
		without a lot of fuss. </p>
		
		<p> The first time I made this I pretty much followed the recipe <br>
		directions and ingredients. The second time, I got a little more <br>
		creative and we ended up liking it even more. </p>

			<li> Arrange chicken pieces in a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br>
