	<h2> Steps </h2>
	
	<h4>
		<ol>
			<li> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.  </li>
			<br>
			<li> Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, <br>
			minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, <br>
			basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands <br>
			to form the mixture into 4 patties.  </li>
			<br>
			<li> Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center <br>
			and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read <br>
			thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).  </li>
